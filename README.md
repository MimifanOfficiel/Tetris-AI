# Tetris-AI
Tetris running with an AI to make it so it can not lose

# Warning and Informations

  ## Origins of this app
    - The idea of doing a Java Tetris app with an AI was not mine at first
    - I got the idea of doing this myself after seeing [this Youtube video](https://youtu.be/DqEirMq7sD0)
  
  ## The code
    - I will check and agree with pull-requests that could help to me to improve the app.
    - Every part code that isn't mine will get the author name in the documentation
  

# Usage

  ## How do I get it ? Run it ?
    - For starters: A runnable jar file will be place in the release section whenever I decide a release can happen
    - For advanced users: You can download the sources and compile it as you wish
    
  ## How does it work ?
    - When running the jar file, the game named "Tetris" will start
    - An Artificial Intelligence is implemented so it will play Tetris.
    - Just sit and watch a nice AI playing Tetris, forever (until you close the app)
